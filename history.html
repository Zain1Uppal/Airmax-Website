    <h2 class= text-gray-700>A Brief History</h2>
    <p class= text-gray-900>Long before the visible Air unit arrived on the scene, Nike had been cushioning the soles of their shoes with the gaseous goodness. Frank Rudy was the man who had the idea of putting air in a shoe, 
        his inspiration for this came from the work he was doing for NASA. Frank was an aeronautical engineer employed by the space program when he approached Nike with his idea. We’re not too sure if NASA 
        would allow that kind of tech sharing these days. Father of the Air Max, Tinker Hatfield, found his inspiration for the inaugural design in the architecture of the Centre Pompidou during a visit to Paris. 
        Hatfield, who was trained as an architect, was taken by the building’s inside-out approach ­— with its structure wrapped around the building’s exterior. From this came the idea to expose the inner workings of the shoe, 
        and the visible Air window was born.</p>
    
    <h3 class= text-gray-600>Cultural Impact of Nike Airmax</h3>
    <p class= text-gray-800>The line of sneakers is popular amongst many subcultures, for example hip hop and gabber.
        In the mid-1990s the line, especially the Air Max 95 model, experienced such a surge of popularity in Japan 
        that it led to a phenomenon known as "Air Max hunting". The extremely inflated prices of the shoes led to a rash of 
        muggings in the normally-peaceful country wherein Air Max wearers were attacked and their shoes were stolen. Even used shoes were in 
        demand, and fakes also became a serious problem.</p>
